# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to implement machine learning and neural networks by using the features in a provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Alphabet Soup is a fictional organization that has helped fund over tens of thousands of organizations over the years. They have sent over a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
